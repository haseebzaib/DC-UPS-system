# DC-UPS-system
I made this simple DC ups which will charge 12V battery with solar power and main power.It is programmed in such a way that it will priortize solar power first but if the voltages drop from desire voltage it will switch to main power and if for some reason there is no main power and solar power is also not of desired value it will still switch to solar
